\section{Dependent Types}
pi type are dfependent function type gejneralizes function type
sigma type are dependent pair (product) type generalizes product and sum types

but we also have a relation between pi types and product types (Thorsten Altenkirch video)
(TO USE LATER mopre precisely a dependent type csan be seen as function where its codomain depends on its domain. 
In thius light a function is a 
 just a weaker form of a dependent type also dependen type avopid run time errors)

talk abnout family types

Connect to predicate logic and extend Curry-Howard.

a prediacate is a function from a type to Prop
P : A -> Prop
actually a dependent function 
and a term of type
pi x : A, P x
is a proof that P holds for all x : A in A
which is a proof of the universal quantification
forall x : A, P x
family of types indexed by A

a term of type
sigma x : A, P x
is a pair (a, p) where a : A and p : P a
which is a proof of the existential quantification
exists x : A, P x
family of types indexed by A  

Tautology top prove 

for (all x : A, P x -> Q x) iff (there exist x : A, P x )-> Q x (Thorsten Altenkirch  video)
tyhe proof is currying and uncurrying
