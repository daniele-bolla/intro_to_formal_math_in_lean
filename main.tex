% Abstract
\begin{thesisabstract}
    This thesis serves as an introduction to formal mathematics using the
    Lean proof assistant. After a brief overview of the Curry--Howard
    correspondence, we explore how mathematical structures and
    properties are defined in Lean.
    Finally, we present a formalization of the topologist's sine curve,
    which has been merged into the Mathlib library as a modest contribution
    to the broader Lean community.

    During the work on this thesis, I have explored new concepts
    in both mathematics and computer science, starting from logic and
    type theory within the Curry-Howard correspondence.
    The practice of formal and constructive mathematics has influenced
    my approach to mathematical reasoning. In building the rational
    numbers, I explored their algebraic construction using quotients,
    which is reflected in Lean through quotient types. I further examined
    how algebraic structures such as groups and rings are defined using
    structures and type classes. For more technical depth, I studied
    filters to generalize the notion of convergence in topology.
    The formalization of the topologist's sine curve has deepened
    my understanding of connectedness, closures, and continuity.

    The full code accompany this project is available

\begin{acknowledgments}
    I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. David Loeffler for
    the consistent support.
    His mentorship has been particualary beneficial in enlightening my path through
    formal mathematics, shaping the thesis and giving me a chance to
    actually contribute to Lean community.

    Moreover, I deeply thank FernUni for the opportunity to pursue my
    studies. I feel honored to have been able to study
    mathematics at this stage of my life, through a flexible and
    high-quality program.

    I hope to continue my studies in the future.
