# Introduction to Formal Mathematics in Lean with an Example in Topology

This repository contains the source latex code for my 
bachelor’s thesis project in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at FernUni.

The project aims to provide an introduction to formal mathematics using Lean, with a focus on the **practical application** of theorem proving rather than a detailed exposition of the language itself.

The accompanying code examples are available here:  
🔗 [Intro to Formal Mathematics in Lean](https://github.com/daniele-bolla/intro_to_formal_math_in_lean_code)

Within this project, I include a formalization of the classical result that the **topological sine curve** is connected but not path-connected.

The work takes inspiration from Konrad Conrad’s exposition:  
📄 *“Connected but Not Path Connected”*

The formalized and revisited proof is available as a pull request in Mathlib4: 🔗 [mathlib4#25529](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25529)
